# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Language

Write everything in English: commit messages, pull request titles and
descriptions, issues, code comments, documentation, and file names.

The only exception is the Chinese copy of the site itself, the `zh`
entries in `src/i18n/content.ts` and the Chinese résumé PDF. Keep those
in Chinese.

## Commits

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- Subject: `<type>: <summary>` in the imperative mood, lowercase after
  the colon, no trailing period, at most 72 characters. Common types are
  `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `chore`.
- Leave a blank line after the subject, then write a body wrapped at 72
  characters that explains what changed and why.
- Keep each commit to one logical change.

## Adding a project

Projects are Markdown files in `src/content/projects/<lang>/<slug>.md`,
one per language with the same `<slug>`. The frontmatter schema lives in
`src/content.config.ts`:

```yaml
---
title: Project name
description: One sentence, shown in the list and as the page description.
date: 2026-10          # month the project shipped or started
status: live           # live | wip | archived
stack: [Go, TypeScript]
repo: https://github.com/jma49/...   # optional
demo: https://...                    # optional, a URL or a site path
cover: ../covers/<slug>.jpg          # optional preview image, 16:10
capture: /                           # optional page to screenshot into cover
---
```

Preview images live in `src/content/projects/covers/`, shared by both
languages; Astro converts them to AVIF/WebP at the sizes each layout
needs. Projects without a cover show their title on a plain tile.

Set `capture` (in one language's file) to have the cover generated: a
site path like `/` is captured from the local build, a full URL from the
live site. Run `npm run preview:capture` to update covers locally. The
`Update project previews` workflow runs it on every push to `main`, on
macOS so the serif fonts match, and commits covers whose pixels changed
by more than 0.1%. Don't edit a captured cover by hand; it will be
overwritten.

The home page list, the pages at `/projects/<slug>/` and
`/zh/projects/<slug>/`, the sitemap and `llms.txt` all update
automatically. If a project has no Chinese file, its English page is
still built and the language switch falls back to the Chinese home page.

Put a client-side tool that needs no backend under `src/pages/tools/`
and hydrate its React component only on that page. Deploy a tool that
needs a server or API keys as its own project on a subdomain, and link
to it from `demo`.
